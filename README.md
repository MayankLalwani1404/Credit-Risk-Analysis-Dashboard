# 📊 Credit Risk Analysis: Loan Default Insights

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a credit risk dataset to identify patterns and factors contributing to loan defaults.
Using SQL for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, the project uncovers key risk indicators to support better lending decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze loan default behavior
* Identify high-risk customer segments
* Understand impact of income, employment, and loan purpose
* Build an interactive dashboard for decision-making

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **SQL (SQLite)** – Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
* **Tableau** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
* **Excel/CSV** – Data source

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation (SQL)

* Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
* Created derived features:

  * Income Group (Low / Medium / High)
  * Loan-to-Income Ratio
  * Risk Segmentation
* Validated binary target (`loan_status`) for accurate default rate calculation

---

## 📊 Key Metrics

* **Total Loans:** 32,581
* **Default Rate:** 21.82%
* **Average Loan Amount:** 9,589

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features

* Default Rate by Income Group
* Employment Length vs Default Risk
* Income vs Loan Amount (Scatter Plot with Log Scale)
* Risk Segmentation Analysis
* Loan Intent Analysis
* Loan Status Distribution

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Low-income customers show significantly higher default rates
* High-risk segment contributes disproportionately to total defaults
* Higher loan-to-income ratio strongly correlates with default risk
* Certain loan purposes (e.g., debt consolidation) have higher default rates
* Short employment length is associated with higher default probability

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Import dataset into SQLite
2. Run SQL scripts for data preparation
3. Export processed data
4. Load into Tableau
5. Build dashboard using provided structure
